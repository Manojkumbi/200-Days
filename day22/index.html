    <h1>Applications of Java Data Structures</h1>

    <div class="data-structure">
        <h2>1. ArrayList</h2>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Dynamic arrays where random access is required.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Used in applications where data needs to be stored and accessed sequentially, like list-based menus in graphical interfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Caching:</strong> Suitable for in-memory caches, such as loading paginated data where resizing may be needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Search Algorithms:</strong> Works well for cases where fast read and search operations are required, as it allows direct access via indices.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="data-structure">
        <h2>2. LinkedList</h2>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Linked list implementations where frequent insertions and deletions occur.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Chat Applications:</strong> Messages can be appended and removed efficiently without shifting other elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Undo Functionality:</strong> Each operation can be represented as a node, and actions can be undone by traversing back through nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Music Playlists or Photo Viewers:</strong> Can model playlists or image viewers where users can navigate forward or backward between elements.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="data-structure">
        <h2>3. Stack</h2>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) operations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Browser History:</strong> Storing previously visited pages, where the user can go back to the last visited page.</li>
            <li><strong>Expression Evaluation:</strong> Used in parsers for evaluating mathematical expressions in programming languages.</li>
            <li><strong>Undo Functionality:</strong> Stores actions in applications, allowing the user to undo the most recent operation first.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="data-structure">
        <h2>4. Vector</h2>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Dynamic arrays with thread-safe operations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-Threaded Applications:</strong> Useful for synchronized collections, such as a thread-safe version of ArrayList in legacy systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Buffers:</strong> Used in networking applications where data is constantly being added and retrieved.</li>
            <li><strong>Banking Transactions:</strong> Often employed in applications requiring thread safety, like transactions where records are accessed by multiple threads.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="data-structure">
        <h2>5. HashSet</h2>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Collection of unique elements with fast lookup.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unique Data Storage:</strong> Suitable for storing unique items, such as IDs or product codes in e-commerce.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Filtering:</strong> Used in applications that filter duplicate data, such as removing duplicate entries from a list of IP addresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Often used for fast lookup of unique in-game items collected by a player.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="data-structure">
        <h2>6. LinkedHashSet</h2>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Unique elements with predictable iteration order (insertion order).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Order-Preserving Caches:</strong> Useful for caches where both uniqueness and insertion order are important.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Query Results:</strong> When you want to maintain the order of results without duplicates, such as displaying unique items in the order they were retrieved.</li>
            <li><strong>Task Management Applications:</strong> Useful in task managers where tasks need to be stored uniquely and listed in the order added by the user.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
